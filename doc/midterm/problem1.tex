\textbf{1.} A random variable $X$ has the same probability of one third at the points $x=-1,0,1.$  Its entropy is thus $H_X = \log_2 3.$ Let $g(\cdot) $ denote a continuous function and define the random variable $Y=g(X)$.
\begin{enumerate} \item  Find a continuous function, $g(\cdot )$, that reduces the entropy of $Y$ to zero.
\item  Find another continuous function, $g(\cdot )$, that reduces the entropy of $Y$ below the entropy of $X$, but not to zero.
\item  Find a third function , $g(\cdot )$, that generates an entropy of $Y$ equal to the entropy of $X$.
\end{enumerate}
For all three answers, please sketch the nonlinearity and label your axes.
