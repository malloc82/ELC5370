Continuation from Problem~\ref{SquishyBear}.
The distribution of English word length, $k$, is a shifted Poisson random variable. At the end of each word, we will add a space to separate words. There are no spaces allowed in the middle of a word. Under this assumption word length follows the distribution
$$ w(k)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{k-2} }{(k-2)!} ; k=2,3,4,\cdots.$$
Assuming there are about a million words in the English language.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of generating a word in the English language randomly choosing letters
  \begin{itemize}
  \item assuming the letters are chosen uniformly.
  \item assuming the letters are chosen according to $p(x)$.\footnote{
      See Problem~\ref{SquishyBear}.
    }
  \end{itemize}
\item What is the probability of randomly generating $W$ words in a row under each distribution?
\item How many times must we randomly sample before getting $W$ words in a row under each distribution?
\item If a word is $w_k$ characters long (including a space at the end), assume it requires $k \log_2 N$ bits to form. How many bits do we use, on average, to query to the point we have $W$ words in a row?
\end{enumerate}
