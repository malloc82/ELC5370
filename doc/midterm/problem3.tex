The average word in English is $\lambda =5.1$ letters.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  If letters are drawn randomly from an $N=27$ character alphabet (A through Z and a space),\footnote{
    We are not considering punctuation, capitalization or numbers.
  }
  then when is a thick novel with $W$ words typical? Explain your reasoning. \\

  \textbf{Solution:} \\
  When
  \begin{align*}
    p\left(X^{\ceil{W*(5.1 + 1)}}\right) & \approx 2^{-W*(5.1 + 1)*(5.1 + 1)}
  \end{align*}
\item Here is a web page of 40,000 sampled words

  \end{center}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Complete the {\bf Count} column in table by including the {\em space}. Call the resulting empirical distribution $q(x)$ where $x=0,1,2,\cdots$ corresponds to (space, e, t, a, o, $\cdots$).
  \item Find the value of $\alpha$ that minimizes the Kullback-Liebler distance between the distribution corresponding to this augmented table and
    $$p(x) = (1-\alpha) \alpha^x $$
  \item Compare this to the $\alpha$ that minimizes
    $$ \sum_{x=0}^\infty \left| p(x) -  q(x) \right|^2 $$
  \item What is the average word length in English based on $q(x)$? On $p(x)$?
  \end{enumerate}
